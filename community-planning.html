            <h1>Community Planning & Future Amenities at Pine Hill Enclave</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Where Nature Meets Thoughtful Living</p>
            <p>At Pine Hill Enclave, we are building more than just a residential development â€” we are cultivating a private, secure, and sustainable mountain community. As part of our long-term vision, a range of world-class amenities and shared spaces are being planned to enhance the lifestyle experience for all residents.</p>
            <p>From fitness and leisure to dining and outdoor recreation, every element of our community planning reflects the values of peace, well-being, connection, and timeless design â€” all set within the breathtaking landscape of the Galiyat region.</p>

            <h2>Phase Two: Amenities That Elevate Mountain Living</h2>
            <p>Our next phase of development will include the construction of central shared facilities and services. These plans are already underway and will be activated once the community reaches 15 completed and occupied homes. This milestone ensures sustainability, efficiency, and a vibrant neighborhood environment to support these shared amenities.</p>

            <h2>Why Thoughtful Community Planning Matters</h2>
            <p>Unlike large-scale housing projects, Pine Hill Enclave is a low-density, private development where each homeowner contributes to a shared vision. Community planning here is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Phased to align with actual resident needs</li>
                <li>Sustainable by design, avoiding overdevelopment</li>
                <li>Service-driven, prioritizing comfort and continuity</li>
                <li>Tailored for like-minded individuals seeking privacy, nature, and long-term value</li>
            </ul>
